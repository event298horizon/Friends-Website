          <p>
            Ross is a paleontologist and has a Ph.D. from Columbia
            University.His romantic feelings toward Rachel Green, which began as
            a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative
            arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a
            nearly constant theme of Friends. Raised on Long Island, Ross is the
            elder brother of Monica Geller, and son of Jack and Judy Geller.
            Ross and Monica are Jewish and see themselves as at least cultural
            Jews, with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his
            son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in
            the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a
            lesbian.

            Rachel comes as a runaway bride who is distraught after abandoning

            Chandler's best friend is Joey Tribbiani, who is his roommate. He
            previously lived with his good friend Ross Geller. He met Ross'
            sister, Monica Geller, and her friend, Rachel Green, while
            celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the
            first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel. He moved to New
            York City and lives across the hall from Monica. He attributes his
            sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents'
            divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of
            his friends' circle on account of responsible income management,
            having learned the value of money from a young age.

          <p>
            Hardworking chef, Monica was one of five close-knit friends who live
            in New York City, including her older brother Ross, neighbors Joey
            and Chandler, and former roommate Phoebe. When her privileged,
            inexperienced childhood best friend Rachel, with whom she had long
            lost contact, suddenly arrives in her neighborhood unannounced as a
            runaway bride after abandoning her own wedding, Monica allows her to
            move in with her while she attempts to reorganize her life, and the
            two reconnect. She was badly addicted to cleanliness and organizing
            things which sometimes caused her other friends to get frightened if
            they would do some change with her stuff.

          <p>
            Joey is an Italian-American struggling actor who lives in New York
            City with his roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing. He had more
            luck for getting dates than any of the other five members. Although
            Joey dates so many women, very few of these relationships are
            serious, his romantic partners rarely appearing for more than one
            episode. However, despite his great interest in women, Joey has made
            it clear more than once that his friends are more important to him;
            when his latest relationship, Janine, stated that she dislikes
            Monica and Chandler, Joey breaks it off with her despite the fact
            that he had been trying to win her over for a long time.

            Phoebe was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank and Lily
            Buffay. Phoebe has a twin sister, Ursula, a waitress who is also
            portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including
            French and Italian. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her
            offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's
            roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the
            group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with
            their neighbors, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, and also Monica's
            brother Ross Geller. She plays acoustic guitar and sings simple,
